The film and novel recount the story of a young white woman and aspiring journalist Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan. The story focuses on her relationship with two black maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, during the Civil Rights Movement in 1963 Jackson, Mississippi. In an attempt to become a legitimate journalist and writer, Skeeter decides to write a book from the point of view of the maids, exposing the racism they face as they work for white families. Black domestic workers in 1960s America were referred to as \"the help\", hence the title of the journalistic exposé, the novel and the film. \"The Help\" brings to light the challenges and discrimination that African American people faced.",

  "movies_description": "A Haunted House is a 2013 American horror satire film directed by Michael Tiddes, written by, produced by and starring Marlon Wayans. Although Wayans said the film was \"not exactly a parody but rather a movie with funny characters doing the opposite of what typical people do in similar horror films,\" the film pokes fun at the \"found footage\" horror genre, such as Paranormal Activity and The Devil Inside. It was released on January 11, 2013 and was panned by critics, but grossed $60 million against a budget of $2.5 million. A sequel, A Haunted House 2, was released on April 18, 2014.",
