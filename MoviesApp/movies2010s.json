The story focuses on her relationship with two black maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, during the Civil Rights Movement in 1963 Jackson, Mississippi. In an attempt to become a legitimate journalist and writer, Skeeter decides to write a book from the point of view of the maids, exposing the racism they face as they work for white families. Black domestic workers in 1960s America were referred to as \"the help\", hence the title of the journalistic expos√©, the novel and the film. \"The Help\" brings to light the challenges and discrimination that African American people faced.",
